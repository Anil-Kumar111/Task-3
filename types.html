            <h2><i>Types of Fabric</h2>
            <p><There are various types of fabrics, each with unique properties and uses:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cotton:</strong> Known as the most popular material in the world, cotton is a light, soft natural fabric. The fluffy fiber is extracted from the seeds of the cotton plant in a process called ginning. The fiber is then spun into cloth, where it can be woven or knit.This fabric is praised for its comfortableness, versatility and durability. It is hypoallergenic and breathes well, though it doesn not dry quickly. Cotton can be found in virtually any type of clothing: shirts, dresses, underwear. However, it can wrinkle and shrink.Cotton yields many types of additional fabrics, including chino, chintz, gingham and muslin.</li><br><br>


                <li><strong>Silk:</strong> Known as the world most luxurious natural fabric, silk is another soft, elegant fabric choice with a smooth touch and shimmering look. Silk comes from the silkworms cocoon, which are found in China, South Asia and Europe.It is the most hypoallergenic, durable, strongest natural fabric, though it is difficult to clean and delicate to handle; many fabric weaves tighten or pucker when washed, so it iss best to hand wash or dry clean silk. Like lace, satin is expensive due to the time-consuming, delicate process or turning the silk thread into yarn.Silk is mostly used in wedding and evening gowns, shirts, suits, skirts, lingerie, ties and scarves. The two most popular types are Shantung and Kashmir silk.</li><br><br>


                <li><strong>Wool:</strong> Our last different type of fabric is wool. This natural fiber comes from sheep, goat, llama or alpaca fleece. It can be knitted or woven.Wool is often noted for being hairy and itchy, though it keeps the body warm and is durable and long-lasting. It is also wrinkle-free and resistant to dust and wear and tear. This fabric can be a bit expensive, as it needs to be hand-washed or dry-cleaned. Wool is mostly used in sweaters, socks and gloves.Types of wool include tweed, Cheviot fabric, cashmere and Merino wool; Cheviot fabric is made from Cheviot sheep, cashmere is made from cashmere and pashmina goats and Merino wool is made from Merino sheep.</li><br><br>


                <li><strong>Polyester:</strong>  Polyester is a type of fabric made from synthetic polyester yarns and is somewhat similar to plastic. It is widely used in clothing industry as it is very durable and resistant to shrinking and stretching. It is very strong and light weight fabric and doesn nott need ironing too often making it quite maintainable.Though it is prone to static charge building and hence rubbing people wearing Polyester may give light electric shocks. In popular culture, Polyester is mixed with cotton and this blended fabric is quite prevalent as it tends to provide the best of the both worlds.A disadvantage of Polyester is that it doesn not allow air transfer and hence people wearing is summer find it to be sweaty.</li><br><br>
